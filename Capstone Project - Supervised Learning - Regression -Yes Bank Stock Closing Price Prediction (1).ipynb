We can conclude from the scatter plot that bivariate analysis shows a high correlation of close price with other features. The histogram plots show that they are all right skewed.We used Log Transformation to transform the data because it was moderately skewed to the right. We can conclude from the heatmap that all of the features have a high correlation with one another.
