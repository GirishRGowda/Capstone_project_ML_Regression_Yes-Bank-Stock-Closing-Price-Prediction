# Capstone_project_ML_Regression_Yes-Bank-Stock-Closing-Price-Prediction
YES BANK is a well-known bank in the Indian financial domain; it has been in the news since 2018 due to a fraud case; we have been provided with a dataset that contains monthly stock price data for the bank since its inception, including the closing price, opening price, highest price, and lowest price of each month. The main goal is to predict the closing price of the stock for the month by developing a machine learning regression model with the highest accuracy score.

For understanding and comparing OPEN, HIGH, and LOW pricing, we have used a variety of charts. We developed a total of three machine learning (ML) models for price prediction. The first model employed the linear regression machine learning technique, the second model the lasso regression algorithm, and the third model the ridge regression algorithm.

## **Problem Statement**
**To predict the future price of YES BANK's stock on the National Stock Exchange using a machine learning model of linear regression. We must create a model that will assist us in predicting future stock closing prices.**

## **Methods that we used in this project-**

1.Python

2.Pandas

3.Numpy

4.Math

5.Matplotlib

6.Seaborn

7.Data Visualization

8.Descriptive Statistic

9.Scikit-learn

10.Machine Learning *Algorithm

11.Linear regression

12.L1 and L2 regularization

## **Requirements of this project-**

1.data exploration/descriptive statistics

2.data processing/cleaning

3.predictive modeling

## **DataSet: We had provided a dataset of 185 rows and 5 columns.**

**Name**: YesBank-StockPrices

## **Details for the all given columns given in this dataset.**

**Date**- It describes the date when investors buy or sell the yes bankstock.

**Open**- This feature tells us the date on which the investment is done. We have not given the date but month and year of the investment is given.

**High**- This feature tells us the maximum price of that time.

**Low**- This feature tells us the maximum price of that time.

**Close**- This feature tells the close price for the same day of the stock.
