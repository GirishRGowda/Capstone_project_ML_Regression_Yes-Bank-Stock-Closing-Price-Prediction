# Capstone_project_ML_Regression_Yes-Bank-Stock-Closing-Price-Prediction
YES BANK is a well-known bank in the Indian financial domain; it has been in the news since 2018 due to a fraud case; we have been provided with a dataset that contains monthly stock price data for the bank since its inception, including the closing price, opening price, highest price, and lowest price of each month. The main goal is to predict the closing price of the stock for the month by developing a machine learning regression model with the highest accuracy score.

For understanding and comparing OPEN, HIGH, and LOW pricing, we have used a variety of charts. We developed a total of three machine learning (ML) models for price prediction. The first model employed the linear regression machine learning technique, the second model the lasso regression algorithm, and the third model the ridge regression algorithm.

DataSet: We had provided a dataset of 185 rows and 5 columns.
Name: YesBank-StockPrices

Details for the all given columns given in this dataset.
Date- It describes the date when investors buy or sell the yes bankstock.
Open- This feature tells us the date on which the investment is done. We have not given the date but month and year of the investment is given.
High- This feature tells us the maximum price of that time.
Low- This feature tells us the maximum price of that time.
Close- This feature tells the close price for the same day of the stock.
